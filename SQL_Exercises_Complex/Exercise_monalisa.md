How you will find the thief

When you follow the tutorial you will step-by-step:

-> Find out, who was in Paris at that time.

-> The thief was probably not working alone. Is there any suspicious communication during the time in question?

-> If you find the people responsible, who was the actual wire-puller and who was "only" the henchman?


In dBeaver set the monalisa as the default schema.

## Exercises:

Work in pairs to solve the following tasks

### 1. Investigate the tables

Take a look at the table names and columns. What table could have information about travelling?

### 2. Have a look at the data

What kind of information is stored in the table with travelling information?

### 3. Who all live in Paris?

Get the names of all the people who live in Paris.

### 4. Get all the names who travelled to Paris before 23.10.2014.

### 5. Get all the names who travelled from Paris after 23.10.2014.

### 6. Get all the names who travelled to Paris before 23.10.2014, and whose names also appear in entries for journeys departing from Paris after 23.10.2014. 

### 7. Get all the names of persons who live in Paris or who spent their time in Paris on 23.10.2014 (according to the travel data).


What is the pool of suspects you have left?

- The Local police will visit individuals on the list to inquire about their alibi. Proceed with the previous query, this time we require a list of names and their respective residences. 

- First perform a selection on the flight table where the name is one of those who do not live in Paris. Second, check for every person-residence pair if there is a corresponding flight. For one there is no corresponding flight. Who is this person? Why is this person turning up on that list?

- Now, check the result. Is there something wrong! Do you have the correct list of people who travelled to Paris before 23.10.2014 and who travelled from Paris after 23.10.2014?

## Primary Key and Foreign Key

Now, look at your where statement in the last query you performed. Are the tables person and flight joined by the field name whose entries are not unique? <br>
To prevent mistakes like this we use primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK). People who create a table, usually define a column (or the combination of several columns) which is unique for every entry. This column is called the primary key. Other tables which are referencing entries of this table have a corresponding column, containing the same value as the primary key column of the referenced table. This corresponding column is called a foreign key. 
For example, in our person table, the field id is the primary key. This id is used in the phone_contract table as a foreign key person_id.

person (id) = phone_contract (person_id)

### 8. What foreign keys are used in the table containing the messages and which is the referenced table?

hint: the primary key is unique and the name often contains the suffix "id" and the foreign key columns often contain the name of the referenced table. (this is though only a convention, not always implemented in practice) 

### 9. Try the previous query using the primary key/foreign key connection instead of the name


## WHO is the thief?? - order by and group by

To find out who the thief is, check the text messages stored by the mobile phone providers.

### 10. What are the names of the table containing the text messages and the ones containing phone contracts?

### 11. Get all the text messages which were sent between 2014-10-20 and 2014-10-25.

### 12. Get all the contract ids where the contract.person_id is equal to one of the persons from the results of question 7.

### 13. Get all text messages with the sent date between 2014-10-20 and 2014-10-25 and the contract_sender_id is equal to the contract ids. And where the contract.person_id is equal to one of the persons from the results of question 7.

- You see that you got all the required information but the output looks kind of chaotic. You can order a result set according to a column with an order by phrase. The query to get all text messages from 21.10.2014 ordered by time reads

- select a message from messages where sent like '2014-10-21'
order by sent;

### 14. Get a list of messages from our suspects from the given time period and sort the messages.

### 15.  Who are the thieves? Hint: Read the conversations as they give a clear trace. Check the ids of the sender and receiver of the message and look it up in the person tables!



If you have found the thieves you deserve some break! To practice more SQL, you can continue the investigation of this incredible crime and find out [who was the string puller](http://opentechschool.github.io/sql-tutorial/chapter4.html) when you have some free time.
